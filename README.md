# Android_VisualLinks
An adnroid app for two phones to send and receive messages and picutres using QR codes.

Designed and implemented a QR based "Visual Link" for two Android Devices to communicate wirelessly. The two devices can be made to face each other, and one can be put in the sender mode and the other in the receiver mode to initiate communication. Any data that is entered by the sender is divided into chunks and each chunk is encoded into a QR code. The front camera of the receiver is used to scan and decode the QR code and the decoded text is further encoded by the receiver and displayed on its screen to act as a synchronization feedback for the sender. The sender on scanning and verifying the code displayed by the receiver, moves onto the next chunk after being satisfied about a successful transfer. An adaptive feedback system was implemented based on the "STOP-AND-WAIT" protocol, where the sender decreases the amount of data in each QR code in case it fails to get feedback from the receiver within a predetermined period of time. Support for transferring pictures and contacts was also added to this Android APP.
